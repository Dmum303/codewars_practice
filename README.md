Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.

For example (Input --> Output):

39 --> 3 (because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4 = 4 and 4 has only one digit)
999 --> 4 (because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126, 1*2*6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2)
4 --> 0 (because 4 is already a one-digit number)

The Cat In The Hat has cat A under his hat, cat A has cat B under his hat and so on until Z

The Cat In The Hat is 2,000,000 cat units tall.

Each cat is 2.5 times bigger than the cat underneath their hat.

Find the total height of the cats if they are standing on top of one another.

Counting starts from the Cat In The Hat

n = the number of cats

fix to 3 decimal places.

I need to iterate through n and each time make the height 2.5 times smaller, have a total height counter which adds each height up and return that number as a string fixed to three .000
So have starting value of store += h, h / 2.5
